There are several ways to attack OTP. One of these is attacking to integrity. 
For example, Let imagine we have a message M ("Hello Bob") send from Alice to Bob. 
As Alice want send message in security, Alice will set a Key K with Bob (l"5ecEr3tKEY", length of K is the same as M) after that the message will be applied OTP and send Cipher-text to Bob. 
Now, we are Eva who want to change the massage M, cause of OTP algorithm, we can only change message in to equal length massage. 
Suppose that we want to change message into "From: Eve". Let look inside Algorithm:
